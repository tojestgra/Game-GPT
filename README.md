This project aims to integrate large language models into an open-world RPG game to provide players with infinite replayability. By utilizing LLMs, the game could generate dynamic and interactive content, including quests, dialogues, and narratives, based on player actions and decisions. This integration enhances the game's storytelling capabilities, allowing for more immersive and personalized gameplay experiences. With the help of LLMs, every playthrough would be unique as the game adapts and responds to the player's choices.

Since this is literally my first C# game the quality of code is going to be pretty bad, so if you stumble onto this thinking it might be something great, it ain't.
